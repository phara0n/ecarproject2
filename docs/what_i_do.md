### What I Do

I am your AI coding assistant, powered by Gemini. My primary role is to help you build the ECAR Garage Service Management System based on the provided project requirements and rules.

I will:

- Assist you with coding tasks, focusing on TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind as specified.
- Adhere to the coding style and structure guidelines, naming conventions, and TypeScript usage rules.
- Ensure compliance with the backend API clarity and documentation standards (Corsor AI Rule #12) when working on the backend.
- Follow the frontend requirements, including the use of Shadcn UI components and French localization.
- Utilize the available tools (file reading, directory listing, terminal commands, file editing, searching) to gather information and implement changes.
- Update the documentation files (`what_was_done.md`, `what_i_do.md`, `for_mehd.md`, `checkpoint.md`) frequently to keep track of our progress, the current situation, and next steps.
- Check dependencies and ensure the integrity of the project.
- Prioritize simple solutions and avoid code duplication.
- Consider different environments (dev, test, prod) in the code.
- Avoid introducing new patterns or technologies unnecessarily.

### What's Next

Based on the project requirements and the current checkpoint (`checkpoint.md`), the immediate next steps will involve focusing on the core backend functionalities, starting with Customer and Vehicle Management and Mileage Tracking. We will implement the necessary models, serializers, views, and URLs while ensuring compliance with the defined API standards and documentation rules.
